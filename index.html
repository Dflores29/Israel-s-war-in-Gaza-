        <h1>Israel's war in Gaza</h1>
        <p>Since the 7 October attacks, <em>Israel</em> Defense Forces (IDF) warplanes have carried out air strikes across Gaza while its troops have moved through the territory.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had a "clear goal of destroying <b>Hamas's</b> military and governing capabilities", as well as freeing the hostages. Israel, the UK, US and other Western powers class Hamas as a terrorist organisation. <b>Mr Netanyahu</b> also declared that Israel would have "overall security responsibility" for Gaza "for an indefinite period" after the conflict. However, he later said Israel had no plans to <em>reoccupy</em> the territory. Israel drafted <b>300,000</b> reservists for the operation, boosting its standing force of 160,000.</p>
        <p>After the temporary truce ended, Israeli troops pushed into southern Gaza and began operations against Hamas and other armed groups in and around the city of <b>Khan Younis</b>.
        The ground offensive is now expanding into <em>refugee camps</em> in central Gaza.The IDF has carried out many air strikes on Rafah, near the <em>Egyptian</em> border, where it previously told residents of Khan Younis to flee.There has been fierce fighting in the north, around the <em>Jabalia</em> refugee camp and the Shejaiya district of <b>Gaza City</b>. The UN estimates that 100,000 civilians remain in the north.Israel claims to have killed thousands of Hamas fighters during the war and arrested hundreds.The IDF says 167 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the start of its ground offensive on 27 October.</p>
